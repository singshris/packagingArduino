      <h2>Arduino  Pack Generator, just for you. </h2>

      <h3 style="font-family: Source Serif 4; font-weight: 100"> Every board is unique. So is the packaging it comes in.
      </h3>

      <h5 style="font-family: Source Serif 4; font-weight: 100">
        The limited edition box is now going to be entirely defined by the pin count, weight, and form factor of the Arduino board you choose. Adding your name to our customized package designs is an homage to every member of our tinkering community who uphold our open-source philosophy. Tailored by its configuration and personalized by its receiver, our generator is set up such that no two packages will ever be the same. Here is an Arduino that is yours, yet connects you to us.
